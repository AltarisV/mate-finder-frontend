    Mate-Finder is A University project for the Business Computing 3rd semester-course "Web Technologies".
    Project developed by: Lucas Leiva (MNr. 579799) and Leon Schüßler (MNr. 579906).
    <p>A small Web-Application for students to rate different brands and flavours of Mate-Softdrinks and save those ratings online.</p>
    The plan is to later on add the ability to search for, and find those kinds of drinks via a Maps API.
    At the moment, the site only searches for nearby stores that might sell Mate drinks.
