# mate-finder-frontend

Mate-Finder: A University project for the Business Computing 3rd semester-course "Web Technologies". 
Project developed by: Lucas Leiva (MNr. 579799) and Leon Schüßler (MNr. 579906). 
A small Web-Application for students to rate different brands and flavours of Mate-Softdrinks and save those ratings online. 
The plan is to later on add the ability to search for, and find those kinds of drinks via a Maps API.

This is the Front-End of the Project.
